# Learning C# Design Patterns Demo

Small example showing use of design patterns in C#.

This sample was created for my own use during lectures, so nothing fancy here :-).

More info about design presented design patterns can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

There are some great examples of design patterns that can be found on GitHub, one example being [Design Patterns Explained with Food](https://github.com/wesdoyle/design-patterns-explained-with-food).

I would also highly recommend this website: [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).
