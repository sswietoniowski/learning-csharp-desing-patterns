# Builder Design Pattern

## Objectives

The Builder Pattern in practice:

- defining an object class,
- adding a builder interface,
- creating a concrete builder class,
- implement a director class,
- update to Fluent Interface variant,
- review use cases and applications.

## Design Patterns Categories

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern.

## Definition

> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

Abstracts out initialization code.

Representations created as concrete classes (constructed from interface blueprint).

Director class handles actual object creation (controls where & what data is used).

## Key Points

Builder is useful when creating complex objects.

When object creation needs to be separate from its assembly.

When different representations need to be created with finer control.

## Builder Use Cases

Not for everything - it's overkill for most classes (use factory instead).

Bloated class constructor are a dead giveaway.

Lots of computation logic in class constructor needed to set class field values.

Finite number of related classes that perform similar functions with different representations.
